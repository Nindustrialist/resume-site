    <p>
      I'm a quick-learning software engineer that loves thinking about, and solving, difficult
      problems. I enjoy designing and developing web sites, and have over ten years of experience
      doing full stack SSMS, .NET, and JavaScript development. I have been working deeply in Angular
      and AngularJs for the last seven years, but I also have experience with React and plenty of
      JavaScript/TypeScript libraries. I have a strong foundation in object oriented programming,
      and I am also very comfortable with functional programming styles as well. I am looking for a
      fully remote position with interesting problems to solve at a company that values work-life
      balance.
