    <p>
      I'm a quick-learning software engineer that loves thinking about, and solving difficult
      problems. I also enjoy designing and developing web sites, and have over ten years of
      experience doing full stack SSMS, .NET, and JavaScript development. I have been working deeply
      in Angular and AngularJs for the last seven years, but I also have experience with React and
      plenty of JavaScript/TypeScript libraries. I have a strong foundation in object oriented
      programming, and have also become very comfortable with functional programming styles as well.
      I am looking for a fully remote position, with a flexible company that has interesting
      problems to solve.
